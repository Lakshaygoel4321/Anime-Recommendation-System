<h1>🎥 Anime Recommendation System: A Data Science Project</h1>

<h3>📄 Project Overview</h3>

The "Anime Recommendation System" is designed to enhance user experiences by providing personalized recommendations for anime shows. If a user selects a specific anime, the system suggests five similar shows based on their preferences. This project leverages textual features like titles, genres, and synopses to build a robust recommendation system.

By preprocessing and analyzing the dataset, the project implements natural language processing (NLP) techniques and cosine similarity to compute the closest matches. The result is a user-friendly tool that helps anime enthusiasts discover shows they’re likely to enjoy 🎉.

<h3>❓ Problem Statement</h3>

Anime datasets often contain missing or incomplete values, making data preprocessing a critical step 🧹. In this project, the dataset had significant null values across multiple columns, including the important features:

<b>Title</b>

<b>Genre</b>

<b>Synopsis</b>

<b>Type</b>
<br>
<br>
To address this, preprocessing steps were applied to clean the data. Finally, a new "tag" column was created by combining the textual features (genre, synopsis, and type) to serve as the primary input for the recommendation model.
<br>
<br>

<h3>🎯 Objective</h3>
<br>
The primary goal of this project is to create a system that:
<br>
🎥 Recommends five similar anime shows based on a user’s selection.
<br>
🛠️ Utilizes natural language processing and similarity techniques to process and compare anime descriptions.
<br>
🚀 Enhances user satisfaction by providing accurate, personalized recommendations.

<h3>📊 Dataset Details</h3>

<b>Source:</b> Company-provided dataset.

<b>Size:</b> 17,002 rows and 15 columns 🗂️.

<b>Type of Data:</b> Structured data, including textual and categorical features.
<br>
<br>

<br>
<h3>🛠️ Methodology and Techniques</h3>
<br>
<h3>1. Data Preprocessing:</h3>

Cleaned null values in critical columns like genre and synopsis.

Combined key textual features (genre, synopsis, type) into a new column called "tag" for analysis.

Performed text cleaning, such as lowercasing and removing special characters.
<br>
<br>

2. Feature Vectorization:

Converted textual data into numerical vectors using Bag of Words (CountVectorizer) 🧮.

This step transformed the "tag" column into a matrix suitable for similarity calculations.
<br>
<br>

3. Similarity Computation:

Used Cosine Similarity to measure the similarity between anime vectors.

The system ranks all anime shows based on their similarity to the user-selected show, returning the top 5 recommendations 📋.

<h3>✨ Results and Insights</h3>

1. System Performance:<h

Successfully implemented a recommendation system that returns accurate and relevant anime suggestions 🎉.

The top 5 recommendations were consistently well-matched to user-selected shows, based on genre and synopsis similarity.



2. Insights:

The genre and synopsis of an anime significantly influence its similarity to other shows.

Users are more likely to watch shows with overlapping themes and storylines.

<h3>🚀 Challenges Faced and Solutions</h3>

1. Data Cleaning:

Challenge: Significant null values in important columns like genre and synopsis.

Solution: Applied imputation techniques and removed rows with excessive missing values.



2. High Dimensionality:

Challenge: The Bag of Words model created a sparse and high-dimensional matrix.

Solution: Used dimensionality reduction techniques to optimize memory usage and computation speed.



3. Cold Start Problem:

Challenge: Recommendations for anime shows with little data were less accurate.

Solution: Added fallback logic to recommend popular shows with similar genres.
